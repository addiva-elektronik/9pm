o No one-line if's or procedures
o Bool return values are "FALE" or "TRUE"

NAMESPACE AND SCOPE
-------------------
o Top level namespace (::9pm) should be empty ("fatal" is a current exception).
o Second level namespace names should be unique i.e. not collide with
  anything in TCL/Expect/tcllib.
o Users should be able to use "namespace path ::9pm" to recursively import all
  second level namespaces and there childes.
o Procedures should strive to use variables inside there own namespace.
o All internal references outside of own namespace should be absolute from
  global (::9pm::foo::bar).
